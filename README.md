# MSDS Capstone 2022: Route Reccomender and Quality Map using OpenBeta Data 
## By: Nina Hernandez

    Following the sport of climbing’s Olympic debut in Tokyo 2021 and the success of films like Free Solo featuring Alex Honnold (2018) and The Dawn Fall featuring Tommy Caldwell (2018), the population of climbers is exploding and the industry is expected to keep evolving. According to Forbes, google searches that included the term “climbing” reached an all time high in the first week of August 2021; the same time frame that men’s and women’s combined events were held (1). Not only is the sport gaining a bigger audience, but it is also attracting people like you and me to take a crack at the crag. Following the pandemic, nearly 100 climbing gyms have opened in North America and profits of El Cap, one of America’s largest operators of climbing facilities, saw a 100% increase in online interactions (1). 
    One concern with the sport’s booming popularity is the barrier to entry and as a result, there has been a push to make the sport more accessible. In addition, there are only a few databases with outdoor climbing routes that are in access to the public like The Mountain Project or 8A. Without these platforms, climbers who are looking to hit their local crag or boulder may not be able to find routes or know about the quality of them if they do not already have community or word of mouth. While these websites have provided helpful tools to climbers of all experience and skill levels, they are still heavily lacking data and scrapings of these platforms have resulted in DMCA takedowns or lawsuits. At the bare minimum, we need better and easier access to climbing data so that data scientists like myself can work to advance the sport for others. As the sport grows so will the influx of data, and with any field that is expanding and rapidly changing, data science can add value to it by making better-informed decisions for multiple stakeholders, generating new insights about its players and audience, and increasing the overall experience for users. 
    OpenBeta is a non-profit built and run by climbers that enables “open access and innovative uses of climbing data” (2). Though they have also faced several challenges with their attempt to use OnX’s data from the Mountain Project with copyright infringement and blocked repositories, according to Outside Learn (3). At the moment however, their data is public and the owner Viet Nguyen is making great strides in the climbing and software community. His goal for OpenBeta is to make climbing data more like an open source project, which in turn would help platforms like Mountain Project to increase their recommendation systems, geolocation data, and the accuracy of submissions (3). In addition to pushing for accessible data, the OpenBeta also posts articles that fit the needs of any climber in STEM: tutorials, current events, and project inspirations like recommendation systems and route quality maps. The community that OpenBeta is fostering aligns heavily with the forward mentality of climbing currently which is: don’t be a gatekeeper, spread the beta, and anyone is capable enough. 
    As a young climber and data scientist, I found myself incredibly inspired by OpenBeta’s work and wanted to support the nonprofit by using their data and some of their resources for my capstone project.  I plan to leverage climbing data to influence decision making for climbers of all skill sets and as a result, contribute to the overarching goal of OpenBeta which is to make the sport of climbing safer, more knowledgeable, and more accessible. Recommendation systems are extremely powerful and if done well, can be a great tool for young climbers when exploring outdoor routes. I plan to combine a recommendation and route ranking system in a map format using geolocation and ratings from OpenBeta. While the concept of this project isn’t necessarily inventive, the current work that I’ve seen could benefit from improvements like formatting and simplicity for new users (like theCrag or MP). I think having a recommendation system tailored to the user for routes of varying quality would be ideal for new climbers looking to find their first projects. Don’t get me wrong: it is good to be thorough and these platforms have undoubtedly revolutionized the sport of climbing. But I think that a new climber could benefit from having access to both. I believe that a recommendation system combined with a map also benefits the experienced climber too. For example, if they disagree with a rating or quality assessment of a certain route and as a result a failed recommendation to the climber, the user can enter more data into the Mountain Project (where OpenBeta gets its data) which they believe is accurate. When the data funneling into the model becomes more accurate, you get a better recommendation, a better user experience, increased retention, and so on.
    I believe that any stakeholder (like athletes, sponsors, spectators, media, businesses, brands, participants, etc.) could benefit from this project. Guiding the recent explosion of climbers properly could help make the sport extremely profitable and the climbing community greater and diverse. I hope to help dissolve barriers to entry by providing a tool to climbers that can be utilized as a spot to keep them satisfied, safe, and yearning for more. For the data community, I also want to promote the open source movement in software and data as I strongly believe that it is essential in encouraging innovation, attracting diverse talent, and broadening perspectives within tech.
