I am a MSDS (Masters of Data Science) candidate from Willamette University in Portland, Oregon. I constructed this website which includes a blog post all about my capstone project: "Route Finder App using OpenBeta Climbing Data." The population of rock climbers is exploding and we need more and better access to data to make the sport more accessible. I used data provided from OpenBeta, a nonprofit built and run by climbers that enables "open access and innovative uses of climbing data." I built a Shiny app that includes a map of sport and trad climbing routes in Oregon ranked by route quality and a recommendation engine tailored to the user of any skill level.
